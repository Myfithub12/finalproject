# finalproject

With this project I am trying to create a website for those who keep score at baseball games like fans and coaches. I have created a login page (currently inactive) and am currently working on a csv page to store all information from game-to-game.



To the person checking this project:
Currently, as of 8-2-2024, I have restarted my project. The week before I deleted, moved, or copied code one or more areas that made the original project not work. I have saved some code to help me restart the project but am not sure if I will be able to finish it by the deadline. If this is the case, please let me know through a different readme page to let me know what I can do to improve this project.
